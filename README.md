Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm David. I build stuff with Ruby on Rails and Hotwire and write articles to help others build cool things, too. 

In addition to building SaaS apps and writing, I work as a consultant for companies that align with my values. I'm available for short and long term consulting work to help your company:

- Build Rails applications
- Design and hire your first engineering organization
- Design and refine your product strategy

On my own time, I'm working on:

- [Colby.so](https://colby.so/) - My blog, where I write mostly about Rails and Hotwire, with the occasional diversion to broader engineering and product management topics when the mood strikes. Built with Jekyll and deployed on Netlify
- [Hotwiring Rails](https://landing.mailerlite.com/webforms/landing/d7z0n0) - A curated monthly newsletter on Rails on Hotwire. Powered by MailerLite
- [Vestimonials](https://vestimonials.tv/) - A web app to help businesses capture and share async videos, made with Rails and deployed on Heroku
- **Coming soon** Invoice management for independent consultants - A web app to generate, send, and track invoices, made with Rails and Hotwire and deployed on Heroku. Public beta releasing in September 2021.
