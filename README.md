Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm David. I build stuff with Ruby on Rails and Hotwire and write articles to help others build cool things, too. 

In addition to building SaaS apps and writing, I work as a consultant for companies that align with my values. I'm available for short and long term consulting work to help your company:

- Build Rails applications
- Design and hire your first engineering organization

On my own time, I'm working on:

- [Colby.so](https://colby.so/) - My blog, where I write mostly about Rails and Hotwire, with the occasional diversion to broader engineering and product management topics when the mood strikes. Built with Jekyll and deployed on Netlify
- [Hotwiring Rails](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/hotwiringrails) - A curated monthly newsletter on Rails on Hotwire. Powered by Revue

Want to get in touch? You can [email me](mailto:david@colby.so) or find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/davidcolbyatx)
