Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm David. I build cool stuff with Ruby on Rails and Hotwire, build engineering and product organizations, and write articles to help others build cool things, too. 

In addition to building SaaS apps and writing, I work as a consultant for companies that align with my values. I'm available for short and long term consulting work to help your company:

- Build Rails applications
- Design and hire your first engineering organization

On my own time, I'm working on:

- [Colby.so](https://colby.so/) - My blog, where I write mostly about Rails and Hotwire, with the occasional diversion to broader engineering and product management topics when the mood strikes. Built with Jekyll and deployed on Netlify
- [Hotwiring Rails](https://buttondown.email/davidcolby) - A curated monthly newsletter on Rails on Hotwire. Powered by Buttondown
- [Hotwired ATS](https://davidcolby.gumroad.com/l/hotwired-ats) - A book on building a modern Ruby on Rails application with Hotwire and StimulusReflex, published on my own custom web application with purchasing powered by Gumroad. Rewrite for Turbo 8 publishing spring 2024.
