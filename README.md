Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm David. I build cool stuff with Ruby on Rails and Hotwire, build engineering and product organizations, and write articles to help others build cool things, too. 

In addition to my full-time job and my writing work, I sometimes work as a consultant for companies that align with my values. I'm available for short and long term consulting work to help your company:

- Build Rails applications
- Design and scale your engineering and product organization

On my own time, I'm working on:

- [Colby.so](https://colby.so/) - My blog, where I write about things I find interesting
- Personal apps, built with AI. I'm leaning into Cursor-driven development and figuring out how to make the most of LLMs to ship cool stuff for myself and my family. Some of those cool things are on their way to the app store for other people to enjoy too.

Want to get in touch? You can [email me](mailto:david@colby.so) or find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/davidcolbyatx)
